  First time Setup - Port Conflicts


  Magnet Message's default ports
  ==================================================================

  The followings are the default ports used by Magnet Message.

  - Port 3000
    Used by the Magnet Message web interface

  - Port 5220, 5221, 5222, 5223, 6060, 6061, 9090, 9091
    Used by the Magnet Message server

  There are a few possible scenarios that can cause port conflicts:
  1. These port are used by another service on your system and not available. If they cannot be  made available
     and you need to designate a different port number, please follow the instructions below to change them.
  2. Existing Magnet message processes are already running. Follow the steps below on how to stop them properly.

  Note: Even if you removed the Magnet Message home directory, the processes may continue to run. Follow steps
        below on how to stop orphaned Magnet Message processes.

 
  How to change the default ports
  ----------------------------------------------------
    Steps
     1. Open mmx-standalone-dist/startup.properties
     2. Change any port that is unavailable, and save the file.
     3. Restart Magnet Message. See "How to start, stop, or restart Magnet Message" section.
     4. Open the wizard (http://127.0.0.1:<console_port> for a local installation, or
        http://<ip_address>:<console_port> for a remote one) with a browser and continue with the configuration.

  Note: If you change the ports but cannot connect to the server, check your firewall settings.

  When there is a stale pid file
  ----------------------------------------------------
  Every time when Magnet Message starts, it will save the process ids of the servers in 2 places:
  - mmx-standalone-dist/messaging/bin/mmx.pid
  - mmx-standalone-dist/console/mmx-console.pid

  If the server processes have ended abruptly (e.g., following a system restart), the earlier pid 
  files will remain and the user will see a message similar to the following:
    "Error! mmx-console is already running or you have a stale pid file. If mmx-console is not
        running, please delete ..."

  Please delete the pid file and start the server again with the following commands:
    1. cd mmx-standalone-dist
    2. rm messaging/bin/mmx.pid
    3. rm console/mmx-console.pid
    4. mmx.sh start


  How to start, stop, or restart Magnet Message
  =============================================
  
  IMPORTANT: You should always start and stop the server with the included shell script: “mmx.sh”

   Start:
      1. Use a terminal and go to “cd ~/mmx-standalone-dist".
      2. Execute "./mmx.sh start".

   Stop:
      1. Use a terminal and go to “cd ~/mmx-standalone-dist".
      2. Execute "./mmx.sh stop".

   Restart:
      1. Use a terminal and go to “cd ~/mmx-standalone-dist".
      2. Execute "./mmx.sh restart".


   
   How to force stop orphaned Magnet Message Processes
   ===================================================   
   
   In the event that “mmx.sh” fails to stop the processes or you had removed the existing installation, you can
   find running proccess pids with the the following commands:

     1. “ps aux | grep -e node -e /messaging/lib/startup.jar"
     2. Use the "kill" command to stop the processes.

   Note:  The administration server starts two node.js processes (one parent “start.js” & one child “app.js”).
          You should stop the parent one first, shown in the process list as: 
          “../node-v0.10.36-darwin-x64/bin/node start.js”
